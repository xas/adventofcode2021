# Advent of Code 2021 : solidity edition

This is my attempt to develop solutions of advent of code in solidity, using hardhat test to run the samples files.  

As I am trying to do it in a smart way, there aren't any security thoughts in my code. Yes, I know it is bad.  

But I want to focus on the gas cost side, there is space for better algorithms, so I am open for any issues that pros could see in my code.

Thank you.
